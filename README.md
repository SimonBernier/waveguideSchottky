# THz Wave Control via Moving Dielectric Fronts - SLIPSTREAM Platform

2D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations of terahertz (THz) wave manipulation using relativistic moving fronts in semiconductor-filled waveguides. This work demonstrates temporal stretching and time-reversal of THz pulses through spatiotemporal control of photoexcited carrier density.

## üî¨ Overview

This repository contains the FDTD simulation code used to generate **Figure 2** in our Nature Communications Physics publication on the SLIPSTREAM (Spacetime Light-Induced Photonic STRucturEs for Advanced Manipulation) platform.

The work explores how moving dielectric perturbations - created by photoexciting mobile charge carriers in a semiconductor waveguide - can manipulate THz light in exotic ways including temporal pulse stretching and time-reversal operations.

## üéØ Physical Concept

### The SLIPSTREAM Platform

**Key Innovation:** By tilting the pulse front of a near-infrared pump laser, we create a moving front of photoexcited carriers in a silicon-filled parallel plate waveguide. This front travels at a controllable velocity v<sub>f</sub> relative to the THz wave velocity c/n<sub>Si</sub>.

**Three Regimes:**

1. **Subluminal (v<sub>f</sub> < c/n<sub>Si</sub>)** - THz pulse stretching with quasi-static plateaus
2. **Luminal (v<sub>f</sub> ‚âà c/n<sub>Si</sub>)** - Optimal phase-matched emission
3. **Superluminal (v<sub>f</sub> > c/n<sub>Si</sub>)** - Time-reversal via front-induced transitions

### Physical Mechanism

- **THz Generation:** Built-in Schottky fields at metal-semiconductor interfaces
- **Pulse Shaping:** Spatiotemporal modulation via moving photoexcitation front
- **Control Parameter:** Front velocity tuned by optical pump tilt angle
- **Applications:** Sub-cycle THz control, dispersion compensation, pulse engineering

## üíª My Contributions - Simulation Work

### What I Did (Subluminal Regime Simulations) ‚úÖ

I developed and executed **2D-FDTD simulations for the subluminal regime** that successfully:

- **Modeled the parallel plate waveguide geometry** with silicon and conducting boundaries
- **Implemented Schottky field emission** at top and bottom metal-semiconductor interfaces
- **Incorporated Drude dispersion model** for photoexcited silicon with realistic carrier densities (~10¬π‚Å∑ cm‚Åª¬≥)
- **Simulated moving carrier density fronts** with velocity v<sub>f</sub> = 0.86 c/n<sub>Si</sub>
- **Reproduced experimental THz waveforms** showing temporal pulse stretching
- **Validated the quasi-static plateau formation** mechanism

**Key Achievement:** The simulations in Figure 2 of the paper quantitatively matched experimental data for various beam clipping configurations, confirming our physical understanding of the subluminal pulse stretching mechanism.

### Technical Implementation

**FDTD Algorithm Details:**
- 2D spatial grid with perfectly conducting boundaries
- Time-stepping with Courant stability condition
- Drude model: carrier scattering time œÑ = 0.1 ps
- Schottky field depth: ~1 Œºm (Debye length)
- TEM mode extraction at fixed position
- Post-processing filter for detection response

## üöß Challenges and Limitations

### Superluminal Regime - Numerical Difficulties

**The Challenge:** While the subluminal simulations worked excellently, I encountered significant numerical challenges when attempting to simulate the superluminal regime (v<sub>f</sub> ‚â• c/n<sub>Si</sub>).

**Technical Issues:**
- Standard FDTD algorithms become unstable near or beyond the phase velocity
- Numerical dispersion errors accumulate for relativistic front velocities
- Courant condition violations for fast-moving dielectric perturbations
- Difficulty capturing front-induced transitions at phase-matched conditions

**What Was Needed:**
- Modified FDTD schemes with moving reference frames
- Specialized boundary conditions for superluminal fronts
- Enhanced numerical stability for relativistic regime
- Time-domain formulation of frequency-shifting processes

### Personal Context

Unfortunately, I became seriously ill (cancer diagnosis and treatment) before I could develop and implement the modified FDTD algorithm necessary for the superluminal regime simulations. The paper was published during my recovery period.

**Impact:** The experimental results for time-reversal (superluminal regime) were not independently confirmed numerically in the publication. While the physics is well-supported by theory and experimental data, full numerical validation would have strengthened the complete picture.

## üéØ Bottom Line

**What worked:** FDTD simulations successfully validated the subluminal THz pulse stretching mechanism, providing quantitative agreement with experimental observations.

**What didn't:** Superluminal regime simulations required algorithmic modifications I couldn't complete due to illness.

**Why it matters anyway:** The successful subluminal simulations confirmed our physical understanding and enabled publication of a complete experimental story. Sometimes research challenges come from unexpected places, but the work that *did* get done contributed meaningfully to advancing THz photonics.

*This project demonstrates: electromagnetic simulation, FDTD methods, ultrafast optics, THz photonics, spatiotemporal control, and the reality that research doesn't always go according to plan - but valuable contributions can still be made.*
